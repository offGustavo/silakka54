# Silakka54

Silakka54 is a RP2040 Zero based 54-key column staggered split keyboard. PCB uses hotswap sockets. Design is inspired from REVIUNG41 and Corne keyboards.

PCB is designed for MX style key switches. Current top plate only supports MX style switches. 5-pin switches are supported. I recommend using Vial firmware.

PCB design uses footprints from [ScottoKeebs](https://github.com/joe-scotto/scottokeebs/tree/main/Extras/ScottoKicad "ScottoKeebs") and [kbd library.](https://github.com/foostan/kbd "kbd library.")
